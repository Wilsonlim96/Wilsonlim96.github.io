# PROJECT 1 : CONNECT-4 GAME

## SUMMARY

This project shows a game called Connect-4. It is a strategy game where 2 players go 1-on-1 to own the grid!

Players choose red (player 1) or yellow (player 2) tiles. They drop the tiles into the board, stacking one another starting from the the most bottom row. The first player to get 4 in a row (can be horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins the game.

The Connect-4 game is a great choice for anyone to pit their brains against another player for a quick and exciting game. It is also an excellent choice for anyone looking for a real challenge, to try and win against the AI in the `SINGLE PLAYER` game mode.
